    <h1> Edrei Barajas | WDD 130</h1>
    <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Edrei Barajas" width="200">
    <p>Hello! My name is Edrei Barajas I'm 22 years old and I'm a student. Currently, I work as an MTC
      instructor teaching American missionaries about preaching my gospel and how they can preach the gospel
      in Spanish. I have a lot of hobbies, one of them is playing volleyball with my friends, I love hiking,
      and something I can consider as a hobby is learning languages. My original assignment to serve a mission
      was in Ivory Coast, west Africa, so I learned French, and is a language that I love. Programming is one of my
      favorites, I took some courses and learned a lot about this, but something I realized is that I can use this
      knowledge for the benefit of others and not just too myself. One of the things I want to achieve in the future is
      to know the world and the different cultures and costumes to improve my understanding of this World. When I served
      as a Full-time missionary one of the things that I loved the most was seeing God's hand in the lives of the people
      around me and I became more grateful for the Lord's tender mercies. I love eating, and one of my favorite meals is
      the Carne Asada. It is so delicious and I can eat it forever. There's a lot of food that I enjoy also some
      desserts, the perfect combination for me is to have Ice Cream and chocolate.</p>

    <img src="images/mexico-city.jpg" alt="Mexico City Downtown">
    <p>Mexico City is one of the 32 states in Mexico. It is the capital of the country and is one of the most
      overpopulated cities in the world. The history of the city began in the XIV century with the ancient culture of
      the "Mexicas", who founded the city known as Tenochtitlan and finally conquered it in 1521. The city had
      experienced a lot of changes, with a diversity of governments. One of the tiles of the city is the "City of
      Palaces" because of the buildings and architecture found in the historic center.</p>
