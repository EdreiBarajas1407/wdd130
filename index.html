      <p>Hello! My name is Edrei Barajas I'm 22 years old and I'm a student. Currently, I work as an MTC
                instructor teaching American missionaries about preaching my gospel and how they can preach the gospel
                in Spanish. I have a lot of hobbies, one of them is playing volleyball with my friends, I love hiking,
                and something I can consider as a hobby is learning languages. My original assignment to serve a mission
                was in Ivory Coast, west Africa, so I learned French, and is a language that I love. </p>

      <p>Mexico City is one of the 32 states in Mexico. It is the capital of the country and is one of the most overpopulated cities in the world. The history of the city began in the XIV century with the ancient culture of the "Mexicas", who founded the city known as Tenochtitlan and finally conquered it in 1521. The city had experienced a lot of changes, with a diversity of governments. One of the tiles of the city is the "City of Palaces" because of the buildings and architecture found in the historic center.</p>
