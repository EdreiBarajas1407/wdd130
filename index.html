      <p>Hello! My name is Edrei Barajas I'm 22 years old and I'm a student. Currently, I work as an MTC
                instructor teaching American missionaries about preaching my gospel and how they can preach the gospel
                in Spanish. I have a lot of hobbies, one of them is playing volleyball with my friends, I love hiking,
                and something I can consider as a hobby is learning languages. My original assignment to serve a mission
                was in Ivory Coast, west Africa, so i learned French, and is a language that I love. </p>
